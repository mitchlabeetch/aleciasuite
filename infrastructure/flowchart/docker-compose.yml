# infrastructure/flowchart/docker-compose.yml
# Flowchart.fun — Text-to-flowchart for deal structure diagrams
#
# STATUS: Using external hosted service (20% readiness)
# URL: https://flowchart.fun (free tier available)
#
# RATIONALE:
# - No official Docker image available
# - Source build requires Next.js compilation + dependencies
# - External service is well-maintained, free for basic use
# - Self-hosting adds complexity for minimal benefit
#
# ALTERNATIVE: If self-hosting becomes critical later:
# 1. Clone https://github.com/tone-row/flowchart-fun
# 2. Build static export: npm run build && npm run export
# 3. Serve via Caddy from /app/out directory
# 4. Update Caddyfile: diagrams.alecia.fr { root * /path/to/out; file_server }
#
# For now, team members should use: https://flowchart.fun
# Bookmark this URL or add as PWA for quick access
